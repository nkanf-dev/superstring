// Strict schema/version gate. v1 is frozen; v2 adds the knowledge library.
//
// Mechanism:
//  - The SQLite `user_version` pragma marks the schema version. Only a fresh DB
//    or an exactly matching known schema may receive the ordered migrations.
//    Resource validation happens before opening any file-backed database.
//  - An unrecognised version or structure raises a `REJECT_` error without
//    intentionally changing the database schema or journal mode. Schema decisions
//    run in one transaction; on rejection it rolls back and openBusinessDb closes
//    the connection. This is not a read-only forensic opener: SQLite may recover
//    an existing hot journal or manage sidecars of a database already using WAL.
//  - The gate runs BEFORE any connection-altering write to unknown structures, so
//    a rejected database never leaks an open handle.
