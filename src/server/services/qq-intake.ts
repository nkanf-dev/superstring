// The intake runtime: connection events in, durable observations out.
//
// This is the assembly point the plan lists as P2's remaining item. It connects three
// pieces that each already exist and are tested — the transport (`OneBotConnection`),
// the storage boundary (`recordObservation`) and the trigger (`scheduleQqMemory`) — and
// it owns nothing else. In particular it decides nothing about when to *speak*; that is
// the reply state machine's job (P3).
//
// Two rules are worth stating because they are easy to get backwards:
//
//   1. A PAUSED conversation still observes. Pausing means "stop speaking in this
//      chat", not "forget it": the user's decision was that a paused conversation keeps
//      observing and simply stops talking. Only the *trigger* respects `paused`, and it
//      already does. Recording here must therefore NOT check `paused`.
//   2. An unbound conversation is not ours. `qq_events.agent_id` is NOT NULL, so a
//      message we cannot attribute to an assistant cannot be stored at all. Ignoring it
//      is the correct answer, not a failure.
//
// A handler that throws would abort the transport consumer (the connection reports
// `consumer_error` and stops), so every message is handled defensively and the outcome
// is reported through a callback instead of an exception.
