// P3 durable QQ dispatch: the scheduler that decides *when* a classified initiative runs.
//
// The user's decisions on 2026-09-24 (see TEMP_PLAN_0.3.0 §13 / ADR0018):
//   * conservative event-driven classification - only a real inbound event may start a
//     non-idle path, and a plain group message is only a *candidate* for chiming in;
//   * one global QQ model task at a time; each conversation keeps only its latest candidate;
//   * a lapsed lease is scrapped and re-judged from current facts, never resumed;
//   * the lease is editable (default 120 s, 30-600 s) and renewed about every quarter.
//
// This module schedules and guards. It does not compose prompts, call a model or touch a
// transport, and `authorized` from the commit guard is still not permission to send.

 * `idle_quiet_minutes`, and the user decided on 2026-09-24 that a conversation where nobody
 * has ever spoken is NOT quiet: the assistant's own speech and the binding's age are not
 * baselines either, so a newly bound group is left alone until someone actually talks.

 * re-apply, evaluated here so the queue is not filled with work that is already known to be
 * refused. Both checks are needed and they are not redundant: the trigger gate owns the
 * no-reply rule ("an initiative that got no reply is not followed by another one"), the
 * rhythm gate owns cooldown, hourly cap, active hours and the quiet window itself.
 *
 * The sweep takes only a clock. The allowed-hours gate derives the minute of the local day from
 * that same clock inside `checkQqInitiativeRhythm`, and there is exactly one such derivation in
 * the project on purpose — a second parameter for it here would be a second source of truth.
 *
 * A conversation that already holds a candidate is skipped instead of re-enqueued. Enqueueing
 * would bump `generation` on every sweep, which both invalidates whatever is in flight and
 * pushes `ready_at` forward for ever — the sweep would starve the very task it kept creating.
