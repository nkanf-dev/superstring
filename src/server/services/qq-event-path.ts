// The inbound event path (ADR0018 P2/P3/P4, §7.1): what happens right after a message is recorded.
//
// Intake (`qq-intake.ts`) owns the transport, the housekeeping pass and the storage boundary. This
// module is the second half of the same turn — the three things the plan asks for once a message is
// durably ours:
//
//   1. CLASSIFY. The conservative event-driven decision (P3k) turns a real event into at most one
//      queued candidate: a group message that is not addressed to the assistant becomes a
//      `chiming_in` candidate, a directly addressed one does not enter the queue at all. The
//      classification itself is `enqueueQqDispatchFromEvent`'s job; this module only supplies the
//      facts it needs — including the merge window, which belongs to the conversation's scheme.
//   2. UNDERSTAND THE MEDIA ONCE (§7.1). A picture or a voice message is read when it arrives:
//      addressed or not, the FIRST read is allowed (the user decided on 2026-09-24 that non-@
//      media is read once too), and everything about retries stays in the reader.
//   3. WAKE A FAILED READ ONCE MORE, when the SAME SPEAKER comes back within the scheme's window.
//      That is the user's definition of "相关补充" (2026-09-24) — a fact of the delivery, not a
//      judgement about the words, so it costs nothing to decide and cannot be argued with.
//
// What it never does: send anything, and call a model for a segment that is already described.
// Every guard (feature switch, binding, pause, agent, expiry, attempts, model configured) lives in
// the reader; this module hands it facts and reads its verdict.
