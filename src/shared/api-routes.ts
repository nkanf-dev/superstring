/**
 * The HTTP surface of the app, declared once.
 *
 * Two consumers must agree on it, and they used to disagree:
 *
 *  1. `src/server/index.ts` — the optional static host (`SUPERSTRING_SERVE_WEB=1`)
 *     uses this list to refuse serving `index.html` for an API path, so the SPA
 *     fallback can never shadow a real route.
 *  2. `vite.config.ts` — the dev server must forward every one of these to the
 *     Bun process on 17861. The web client (`src/web/api.ts`) calls them with
 *     relative paths, so without a proxy entry a dev request would hit :5173 and
 *     fail with an HTML 404 instead of the API's JSON envelope.
 *
 * Keeping one list (plus `tests/integration/dev-proxy.test.ts`, which reads the
 * client source and asserts every path it calls is covered) is what stops the
 * second consumer from silently falling behind the first.
 *
 * Pure module: no imports, no side effects, safe for the Vite config bundle.
