/**
 * Unified export barrel for the shared Zod contract layer.
 *
 * This layer is transport-agnostic: it imports ONLY `zod` (no bun, bun:sqlite,
 * node:fs, drizzle, react, or server/browser modules) and contains no business
 * logic. Import from this barrel in both the backend and the React frontend so
 * request/response shapes stay 1:1 with the golden API contract.
